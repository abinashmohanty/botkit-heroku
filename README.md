UXbot is primarily designed to greet new members when they join our GSIUXD slack community.

UXbot is a Slack app and uses OAuth 2.0, and can be added to any slack team via the slack button. 

You can [install our Slack UXbot App](https://slack-uxbot.herokuapp.com/) for you're existing slack team. However, few things to remember. Some of the logics were written specifically for our slack team, so you need to change some of the scripts/channel IDs/etc. You can always test our [development version](#development-version) test our development version as mentioned down here.
